# Threat Hunting with CrowdStrike Falcon Overview

CrowdStrike Falcon is a cloud-native EDR platform that provides extensive telemetry across processes, file operations, and user activity. Threat hunting with Falcon involves analyzing:
- Process execution behavior
- Network activity per process
- MITRE ATT&CK-mapped detections
- Behavioral anomalies and suspicious chains
- Indicators of lateral movement, persistence, or credential theft

## Additional Steps

- Use these keywords in your SIEM (e.g., Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, Elastic) to build queries and alerts
- Correlate Falcon telemetry with network, identity, and email logs
- Leverage CrowdStrike's MITRE ATT&CK alignment for tracking TTPs
- Create dashboards or visual process trees to identify suspicious parent-child relationships
- Consider using Falcon's **Falcon Discover**, **Threat Graph**, or **Overwatch** intel feeds for enrichment
