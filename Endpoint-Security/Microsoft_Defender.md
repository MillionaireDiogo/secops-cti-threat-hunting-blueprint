# Threat Hunting with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) Overview

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) is a robust EDR solution that provides deep visibility into endpoint behavior and integrates natively with the Microsoft ecosystem. It supports advanced threat hunting through its rich telemetry and integration with Microsoft 365 Defender.

Threat hunting in MDE focuses on:
- Real-time and historical endpoint telemetry
- MITRE ATT&CK-aligned detections
- Behavioral analytics
- Process trees and command-line data
- Threat intelligence enrichment

## Additional Steps

- Use these keywords in Microsoft Defenderâ€™s **Advanced Hunting (KQL)** portal or Microsoft Sentinel
- Correlate process behavior with command-line patterns and network destinations
- Monitor for rare parent-child relationships, LOLBin usage, and obfuscated scripts
- Integrate with Microsoft Threat Intelligence (TI) and MITRE ATT&CK dashboards
- Build hunting queries and custom alerts using **DeviceProcessEvents**, **DeviceNetworkEvents**, etc.
