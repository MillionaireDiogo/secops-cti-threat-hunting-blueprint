# Threat Hunting with Sophos Intercept X (EDR/XDR) Overview

Sophos Intercept X with EDR/XDR provides endpoint and server visibility, supporting advanced threat hunting and forensic investigations. It allows security teams to query device telemetry, correlate across multiple data sources, and detect threats using behavioral and rule-based analytics.

Threat hunting in Sophos focuses on:
- Process execution and parent-child relationships
- Threat detections and AI classification
- Script and macro execution
- Network activity and lateral movement
- Policy violations and tampering

## Additional Steps

- Use these keywords with Sophos Centralâ€™s **Live Discover**, **XDR SQL**, or your integrated SIEM
- Focus on behavioral detections, process lineage, and script execution patterns
- Use **Data Lake queries** to correlate endpoint, firewall, and cloud activity
- Build custom alerts and reports based on LOLBin usage, obfuscation, or policy evasion
- Map your hunt results to MITRE ATT&CK tactics for strategic threat coverage
