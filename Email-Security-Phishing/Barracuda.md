# 🛡️ Barracuda Threat Hunting Overview

Barracuda provides a suite of security appliances—**Email Security Gateway (ESG)**, **NextGen Firewall**, and **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**—often deployed at network perimeters. These appliances are prime targets for attackers aiming to:

- Send phishing or malware-laden emails  
- Exploit web applications or network services  
- Bypass security controls or exfiltrate data  
- Abuse administration interfaces  

Threat hunting across Barracuda platforms focuses on tracking suspicious login patterns, policy changes, malware or spam signatures, suspicious HTTP/SMTP activity, and abuse of admin APIs.

## Recommended Log Sources

| Barracuda Product               | Log Source                          | Use Case |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------|
| **Email Security Gateway (ESG)** | SMTP logs, Spam/virus scan reports | Detect spam campaigns, malware payloads, credential phish |
|                                | Admin audit logs                   | Monitor config changes and policy modifications |
| **NextGen Firewall (F-Series)**| Firewall traffic logs              | Identify anomalous connections, exfiltration, port scanning |
|                                | VPN / SSL-VPN logs                 | Flag unusual remote access or brute-force |
|                                | Admin audit logs                   | Detect rule changes or credential misuse |
| **Web Application Firewall**   | WAF event logs (OWASP rules blocked) | Spot web attack patterns like SQLi/XSS |
|                                | Admin audit logs                   | Capture changes to security rules or allowlists |

## Suspicious Events, Keywords & Patterns

### 1. ESG — Email-Based Threats

| Keyword / Pattern            | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `Attachment: .exe`, `.js`, `.docm` | Executable attachments—common in phishing/malware |
| `URL click detected`         | Recipients clicking malicious links |
| `Spam score > threshold`, `virus detected` | Malicious or spam emails passing filters |
| `Failed SMTP auth`, `DOS detected` | Brute-force or abuse of SMTP endpoints |
| `Admin login`, `policy change` | Alert on admin interface changes |

---

### 2. NextGen Firewall — Network Anomalies

| Keyword / Pattern            | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `Deny`, `Dropped`           | Unexpected blocked traffic—flag external scans |
| `VPN login failed`, `Multiple VPN login attempts` | Brute-force or credential stuffing |
| `Geo-location unusual`, `Country not allowed` | VPN or traffic from unexpected geos |
| `New firewall rule added`, `Admin password changed` | Detect perimeter config changes |

---

### 3. 💻 WAF — Web Application Attacks

| Keyword / Pattern            | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `SQL Injection`, `XSS`, `Directory Traversal` | OWASP rule-based attack detection |
| `Zero-day protection`, `Anomaly score high` | Indicates exploitation or probing |
| `HTTP 4xx`, `HTTP 5xx`, large numbers | Suspicious traffic spikes or app errors |
| `Rule bypass`, `Whitelist modification` | Security rule tampering attempts |

---

### 4. Admin Interface Abuse

| Keyword / Pattern            | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `Manage users`, `Add admin`, `Change password` | Privilege escalation or account creation |
| `API key created`, `API integration added` | New access points—validate legitimacy |
| `Remote support tunnel enabled`, `Firmware downgraded` | Persistence tools or potential backdoors |

---

## Additional Tips

- Forward all Barracuda logs to your SIEM (Splunk, Sentinel, etc.) for correlation.
- Baseline normal admin activity and alert on out-of-hours or uncommon IPs.
- Flag repeated VPN or SMTP auth failures—especially from external IPs.
- Watch for spikes in blocked SMTP or HTTP traffic—could indicate campaigns.
- Alert on high spam/virus scores passing scan filters—false negatives can indicate new malware variants.
- Track WAF rule bypasses or calculation anomalies as potential web exploitation attempts.
- Regularly audit admin actions: rule changes, user management, support tunnel usage, firmware upgrades/downgrades.
