# AWS Threat Hunting Overview

AWS threat hunting focuses on detecting suspicious activities by analyzing CloudTrail logs, IAM actions, S3 access patterns, and API calls across services like EC2, STS, Lambda, and RDS. Key threats include unauthorized access, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, and evasion techniques such as disabling logging or modifying resource policies.
