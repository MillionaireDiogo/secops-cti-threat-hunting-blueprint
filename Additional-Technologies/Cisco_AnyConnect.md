## Authentication & Access Events

| **Keyword / Event**                  | **Description / Risk**                                   |

| `FailedLogin`, `AuthenticationFailed`| Multiple/repeated failed logins (possible brute force).  |
| `SuccessfulLogin` (New Device/IP)    | VPN logins from new or unusual devices/IPs/locations.    |
| `MFABypass`, `MFAEnrollmentRemoved`  | Bypassing or removing multi-factor authentication.       |
| `AccountLocked`, `AccountDisabled`   | Accounts locked out or disabled due to suspicious activity.|
| `SimultaneousSessions`               | Multiple concurrent logins for a single account.         |
| `SessionDurationExceeded`            | Abnormally long or persistent sessions.                  |

## Policy & Compliance Events

| **Keyword / Event**                  | **Description / Risk**                                   |

| `PolicyViolation`                    | Breach of VPN or network policy (e.g., unauthorized app).|
| `CertificateError`, `CertInvalid`    | Expired or invalid certificates (MITM risk).             |
| `ComplianceCheckFailed`              | Device failed security/compliance posture check.         |
| `UnregisteredDevice`                 | Devices not in approved inventory.                       |

## Admin & Configuration Events

| **Keyword / Event**                  | **Description / Risk**                                   |

| `GroupMembershipChanged`             | Users added/removed from VPN groups (privilege changes). |

## Threat & Advanced Indicators

- Rapid logins/logouts in short time window  
- VPN access from new or high-risk countries  
- Concurrent sessions from distant geographies (impossible travel)  
- Split-tunnel usage for high-risk users  
- Mass connection failures or brute-force login attempts  
- Devices connecting with outdated/unsupported AnyConnect clients  
- Bypassing posture/compliance checks  
- Admin configuration changes outside normal hours

**Tip:**  
Correlate AnyConnect logs with endpoint security, identity, and network monitoring for a holistic view of remote access risk.
