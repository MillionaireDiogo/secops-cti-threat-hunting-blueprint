## Advanced Threat Indicators

- Sequence of events indicating potential kill chain (recon, initial access, persistence, exfiltration)  
- Chained alerts across users/entities (peer group analytics)  
- Surge in high-risk scores for multiple users/devices  
- Admin actions or role escalations outside business hours  
- Unusual API/integration activity  
- Repeated failure in policy, detection, or logging mechanisms  
- Detection of rarely seen malware or C2 indicators

**Tip:**  
Correlate Exabeam logs and analytics with upstream security tools, endpoint, cloud, and identity sources to create end-to-end threat visibility and response.
