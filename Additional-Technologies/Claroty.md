## Advanced Threat Indicators

- Burst of new asset discoveries or device changes  
- Device communication with known malicious or external IPs  
- Lateral movement or multiple devices breaching segmentation  
- Mass compliance status changes (many devices non-compliant)  
- Large outbound data flows or protocol anomalies  
- Repeated policy violations or threat alerts  
- Firmware or configuration changes outside maintenance windows  
- Disabling of monitoring/logging features

**Tip:**  
Correlate Claroty logs with firewall, SIEM, and network infrastructure logs for unified monitoring across IT and OT environments.
