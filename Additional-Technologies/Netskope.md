## Threat Hunting Log Search Keywords 

| **Keyword / Event**                        | **Description / Threat Scenario**                                           |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `policy violation`                         | User or system actions blocked by DLP, threat, or compliance policy.       |
| `anomalous login`                          | Logins from unusual IPs, geographies, or devices.                          |
| `unauthorized app`                         | Unsanctioned app usage (Shadow IT discovery).                              |
| `malware detected`                         | Threat or malware event triggered in cloud traffic or file upload/download. |
| `data exfiltration`                        | Potential data leakage via uploads, shares, or downloads.                  |
| `file shared externally`                   | Files/folders shared with users outside organization.                      |
| `oauth app granted`                        | User grants OAuth access to a third-party cloud app; possible app abuse.   |
| `failed login`                             | Repeated authentication failures; brute force or credential stuffing.       |
| `admin activity`                           | High-risk or unexpected admin changes (policy, configuration, etc).        |
| `unusual download` / `bulk download`       | Excessive file downloads, may indicate insider threat or account takeover.  |
| `unusual upload` / `bulk upload`           | Unusual volume or frequency of file uploads to cloud services.              |
| `external collaboration`                   | New or unauthorized collaboration with external domains.                   |
| `bypass attempted`                         | Attempt to circumvent security controls (e.g., use of VPN/proxy).          |
| `session hijack`                           | Suspicious session/token activity.                                         |
| `threat intelligence match`                | Activity or traffic flagged by threat intelligence feeds.                   |
| `risky app`                                | Use of apps rated risky by Netskope or threat intel.                       |
| `inline DLP`                               | Inline DLP policy enforcement triggered.                                   |
| `unsanctioned app`                         | Attempts to access blocked or unsanctioned cloud applications.             |

## Netskope-Specific Suspicious Operations & Events

- Multiple anomalous login detections for a single user or app
- Excessive OAuth app grants in a short period
- Large numbers of files shared externally from cloud storage apps
- Repeated or mass downloads/uploads outside normal working hours
- DLP policy triggered on sensitive data (PII, PCI, PHI, source code)
- Sudden spikes in Shadow IT discovery (new cloud apps detected)
- Unusual admin activity, such as rapid policy or configuration changes
- Malware or threat events tied to cloud file transfers
- Attempts to disable or bypass Netskopeâ€™s inline protection

---

## High-Risk Behaviors & Use Cases

- Users granting OAuth permissions to suspicious third-party cloud apps
- Accessing cloud services from risky IPs or untrusted geographies
- File sharing with personal or non-corporate email domains
- Data downloads/uploads outside of standard business hours
- Attempts to access or register unsanctioned cloud services
- Detection of malware or ransomware in cloud file uploads

---

## Advanced Threat Indicators

- Correlation of cloud malware detections with endpoint or network alerts
- Use of cloud services for data staging/exfiltration before departure (insider threat)
- Session hijacking or token replay attempts in SaaS apps
- Use of anonymizers or proxies to mask activity
- Attackers leveraging unsanctioned apps to bypass DLP/policy controls

---

## Response Recommendations

- Monitor all policy violations, anomalous logins, and OAuth grants
- Set up alerts for mass downloads/uploads, external shares, and admin changes
- Regularly review and update sanctioned/unsanctioned app lists
- Enable inline DLP and anomaly detection for sensitive data types
- Educate users about risks of unsanctioned and third-party cloud apps
- Integrate Netskope logs with SIEM for unified security monitoring
